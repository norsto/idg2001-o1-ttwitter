Assignment 1 
Twitter from Temu 

Let’s make a Twitter clone or parts of it, for non-political reasons. 

Features 
The website should mainly consume an API, which should support the following basic 
features. 
    • Post tweets 
    • Edit tweets (?) 
    • List tweets 
    • Search for tweets 
    • Search for hashtags 
    • Make account 
    • List accounts 
    • Search for account 

Architecture 
The system should be split up in three levels: 
    • User-interface level – Written in whatever you want 
    • Processing level – REST API, using FastAPI or Flask, written Python 
    • Data level – Relational database of your choice 

Each of these should be its own service in Render. (You can use different service provides 
if you want.)

The main point of this assignment is the API server, so the exact SQL-ing, the website 
design quality and the correct use of JS frameworks are significantly less important. The 
API-DB-system should be usable by other services than the web server. 
The plan is for assignment 2 to build on this system (mainly API-server). Consider this 
when making your system. The more extensible, the easier to continue later.
